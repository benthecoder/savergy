        - Commercial buildings (6.6%): energy-related emissions from the generation of electricity for lighting, appliances, etc. and heating in commercial buildings such as offices, restaurants, and shops.

        ## Useful Facts to save energy
        1. Electronics that draw power even when theyâ€™re not being used â€“ can add 5% to 10% to your electrical bill, Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) reports
        1. Inadequate windows and doors can drain up to 25% of the heat from your home, according to NRCan
        1. Sealing uncontrolled air leaks can save 10% to 20% on your heating and cooling bills, according to the U.S. Department of Energy
        1. Changing your temperature setting for only eight hours a day could save you up to 10% on your annual heating and cooling costs, the U.S. DOE says
        1. Programmable thermostats can help prevent carbon emissions and reduce your heating bill costs.
        
        
        ## Energy Efficiency Rebates and Incentives
        
        Some utility companies and federal and state government agencies offer tax credits, rebates and other incentives to encourage home energy-efficiency improvements and the use of renewable energy sources.

        The IRS offers the Nonbusiness Energy Property Credit that allows you to take tax credits to help you pay for some energy efficiency improvements you make to your home.


        1. Tax credits of 10% of the cost not to exceed $500 (excluding installation) may be available for some energy efficiency improvements, including insulation, roofs, and windows, doors and skylights.
        1. Renewable Energy Tax credits of 22%, 26%, or 30% are available for renewable energy products that meet specific requirements through Dec. 3, 2023, according to Energystar.gov. These include credits for items including solar energy systems, geothermal heat pumps, and biomass fuel stoves.
